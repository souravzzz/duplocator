Duplocator is a simple command line Java tool to find duplicate files on your computer.

To run this, first download and extract the source files to a location of your choice. 
After going inside the directory, do the following:

$ javac duplocator/*.java
$ java duplocator/Main 

First, it recurses the given directory and builds a list of files.
Then, it looks for files which have the same size.
It then reads those identically sized files, comparing them byte by byte until it finds a byte that doesn't match, or it reaches the end of the file.

It does not use any kind of hashing or CRC system, as that would require reading the entire file, which would be less efficient if a byte near the beginning was different.

The app outputs its errors to stderr, and its results to stdout as it goes.
